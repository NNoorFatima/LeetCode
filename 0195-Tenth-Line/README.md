Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.<br>

Example:<br>

Assume that file.txt has the following content:<br>

Line 1<br>
Line 2<br>
Line 3<br>
Line 4<br>
Line 5<br>
Line 6<br>
Line 7<br>
Line 8<br>
Line 9<br>
Line 10<br>
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:<br><br>

Line 10<br>
Note:<br>
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?<br>
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.<br>
